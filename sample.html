        <p>
        Using jQuery, you can use $(' ') to access elements in an HTML page. They are called query selectors.<br>
        <br>
        To access a class you use "." and to access an id you use "#"<br>
        <br>
        For example..<br>
        <br>
        - To find "first_class" using jQuery we could write $('.first_class')<br>
        - In Javascript, it would be document.getElementsByClassName('first_class')
        <br>
        <br>
        - To find "first_id" we would write $('#first_id')<br>
        - In Javascript, it would be document.getElementById('first_id')<br>
        <br>
        </p>
