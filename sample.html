        <h1>My First Heading</h1>

        <div class="first_class">This text is accessed by finding "first_class" </div>
        <div id="first_id">This text is accessed by finding "first_id" </div>

        <div>>
        Using jQuery, you can use $(' ') to access elements in an HTML page. They are called query selectors.
        </div>

        <div>
            <div class="second_class">To access a class you use "." and to access an id you use "#"</div>
        
            <a id="paragraph">
            For example..
        
            - To find "first_class" using jQuery we could write $('.first_class')
            - In Javascript, it would be document.getElementsByClassName('first_class')
        
        
            - To find "first_id" we would write $('#first_id')
            - In Javascript, it would be document.getElementById('first_id')
            </a>
